## Cloud Application Security Assessment
The App Defense Alliance maintains a catalog of applications which have gone through 3rd party security assessments based on the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS). Specifically, the portions of the standard found in the [ADA Cloud Security Guide (CSG)](./CloudApplicationSecurityGuide.md).

CASA recognizes three tiers of assessment for cloud applications

* Tier three assessments require the developer to complete a self assessment questionnaire, which is then reviewed by a CASA Authorized Lab. This is a paper review of the developer supplied information.
* Tier two assessments require the developer to complete a self assessment questionnaire, which is then reviewed by a CASA Authorized Lab. This is a paper review of the developer supplied information, with the addition of configuration checks.
* Tier one assessments include the steps of tier two, plus a full security assessment by the CASA Authorized Lab.


This repository is maintained by the ADA approved security assessment companies. We encourage input through the issues page from both security assessors and developers.

## OWASP
The Open Web Application Security ProjectÂ® (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. Through community-led open-source software projects, hundreds of local chapters worldwide, tens of thousands of members, and leading educational and training conferences, the OWASP Foundation is the source for developers and technologists to secure the web.

## ASVS
The primary aim of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project is to provide an open application security standard for web apps and web services of all types.

The standard provides a basis for designing, building, and testing technical application security controls, including architectural concerns, secure development lifecycle, threat modelling, agile security including continuous integration / deployment, serverless, and configuration concerns. This standard is maintained by OWASP and can be found at this [link](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS).
